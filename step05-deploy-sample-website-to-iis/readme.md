# Deploy Sample Website to IIS
In this step we will build upon the DSC module we used to install IIS in the last step. This time we will install download files and install custom applications on the server. 
The application we are going to install are: 
- Web Platform Installer 
- Web Deploy 

With these on the server we can deploy a web site to the IIS.
